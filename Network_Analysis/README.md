This courses is given by DataCamp

## Course Description

In this course you'll learn how to work with and visualize network data. You'll use the  ```igraph package``` to create networks from edgelists and adjacency matrices. You'll also learn how to plot networks and their attributes. Then, you'll learn how to identify important vertices using measures like betweenness and degree. Next, this course covers network structures, including triangles and cliques. Next, you'll learn how to identify special relationships between vertices, using metrics like assortativity. Finally, you'll see how to create interactive network plots using threejs.
